        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Eduardo and I reside in Charlotte, NC.</p>
        <p>
          Currently, I work in residential sales for Spectrum but my real
          passion is acting, entertaining, and coding! I have a background in IT
          support and data analytics, which has given me a solid foundation in
          problem-solving and analytical thinking. Combine that with my acting
          chops and creativity, and you've got a dedicated coder who can come up
          with just about anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          My coding journey started in my second year of college when I realized
          just how fun markup language can be!
        </p>
